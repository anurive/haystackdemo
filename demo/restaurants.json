We have strict standards that are among the best in the restaurant business, and our suppliers are checked regularly to make sure they are meeting or exceeding our high standards of food quality.\r\nRed Robin is proud to offer our Guests a wide range of high-quality ingredients including:\r\nBeef \u2013 No preservatives. No artificial trans fats. To create the highest quality gourmet burgers, we have to be very picky about who supplies our domestically sourced beef. We only use USDA certified fresh, never frozen beef to make our burgers. Our standards for selecting the finest quality beef are high, but it takes the very best beef to create the best, most craveable burgers in the business.\r\nPoultry \u2013 No hormones. U.S. law prohibits poultry farmers to add growth hormones to their chickens. But we don't stop there. Like all of our high quality ingredients, we have exacting standards to ensure the chicken we serve our guests is tender, juicy and prepared to perfection. Whether it\u2019s featured in a burger, entr\u00e9e or salad, our chicken is worth crossing the road for!\r\nPork \u2013 Humanely raised food is better quality food, and the pork we serve to our guests is no exception.  Whether it\u2019s our hardwood-smoked bacon on a gourmet burger, or a helping of saucy pork riblets, the standards for our domestically raised pork include humane care for pigs \u2013 treatment that our suppliers are required to verify for us through third-party audits.  Red Robin\u2019s goal is to select only those suppliers who can ensure pigs and other farm animals are raised in a manner that is free of cruelty or abuse.

The history of the DQ\u00ae system is a story of a unique product that created an industry.\r\n\r\nA Story of Sweet Success\r\n\r\nFor more than 70 years, the DQ\u00ae system's recipe for success has been simple. It's been a combination of hardworking people who own and operate restaurants, and great-tasting food and tempting treats served in our establishments.\r\n\r\nOur phenomenal story began with the 10-cent sale of a then unnamed product on August 4, 1938, in Kankakee, Illinois. A father and son partnership in Green River, Illinois, had been experimenting with a soft frozen dairy product for some time. They contacted Sherb Noble, a good friend and customer, who agreed to run the \"all you can eat\" trial sale at his walk-in ice cream store. Within two hours, he dished out more than 1,600 servings of the new dessert.\r\n\r\nBack then, food franchising was all but unheard of, but the new product's potential made it a natural for such a system. When the United States entered World War II in December 1941, there were fewer than 10 Dairy Queen\u00ae stores. However, shortly after the war, the system took off at a pace virtually unrivaled before or since. With only 100 stores in 1947, it grew to 1,446 in 1950 and then to 2,600 in 1955. Today, the DQ\u00ae system is one of the largest fast food systems in the world, with more than 6,000 restaurants in the United States, Canada and 18 other countries.\r\n\r\nAlthough much has changed in the world and in the DQ\u00ae system through the years, one constant has remained: DQ\u00ae restaurants are still, and always have been, the place to find kids' sports teams celebrating a victory, business people on their lunch break and families taking time out to enjoy great food and soft serve treats. And success for the DQ\u00ae system is as simple today as it was in 1940. Satisfied customers lead to successful restaurants. Each owner of our independently owned and operated establishments worldwide is committed to nothing less than the \"Fan Food not Fast FoodTM\" slogan.\r\n\r\nHighlights of the DQ\u00ae system include:\r\n\r\n1940: First Dairy Queen\u00ae store opens in Joliet, Illinois.\r\n1949: DQ\u00ae introduces malts and shakes.\r\n1951: Banana splits appear on the menu.\r\n1953: First DQ\u00ae store opens in Canada.\r\n1955: The Dilly\u00ae Bar debuts.\r\n1957: The Dairy Queen\u00ae/Brazier\u00ae concept is introduced.\r\n1958: The Dairy Queen\u00ae/Brazier\u00ae food products are introduced.\r\n1961: The Mr. Misty\u00ae slush treat cools throats in the warm South.\r\n1962: International Dairy Queen, Inc.
